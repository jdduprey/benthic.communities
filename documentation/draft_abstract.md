 * oomycetes are important saprotrophs, energy conduits in marine/estuarine food web  
 * pathogens to economically and ecological important species
 * how much is known about aquatic and marine oomycetes residence times in estuaries across salinity gradient?
 * "correlations with abiotic environmental condition" suggest some amphibious ability
 * how much is known about seasonality, abundance along pH/temp/carbon chemistry gradients
 * there have been lab studies but less ecological context - especially marine
 * metabarcoding allows for simultaneous oomycete/saprotroph id and environmental/ecological context
 * saprolina diclina - salmon pathogen
 * anisolpidium ectocarpii - brown algae pathogen
